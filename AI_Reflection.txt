USE OF AI

1. I used AI to generate the ERD as I didn't want to draw it myself. I designed it myself, but I feed the info
to an AI to generate the picture. 

2. Most if not all css was done by copilot. 

3. Copilot autocomplete was done on some of the backend controller functions,
as they are very similar. 

4. AI was also used in some debug steps on the frontend. Mainly with fetching data and storing it.

TECHNICAL DECISIONS

I decided to add a few sample teams,venues and sports. As therwise the application wouldnt work
and this was less work than implementing api so the user can add them and also made it simpler for 
the user as he doenst need to add a sport before he can add a team, etc.

MORE TIME

If I had more time I would implement all functions (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE) for all tables 
in the database. I would also cleanup the frontend and make it look nicer.

# Sportsradar

## Stack:

- **Golang + Gin** backend  
- **SQLite** database  
- **React + Vite** frontend 

## Overview

The backend has a few API endpoints, mainly GETs for each table
events also has POST and GET/:id.

The frontend is basic React code with some fetching. 
The only real page is the event page which shows all 
the events and contains a with which the user can add events.
Since we didn't need to implement adding any of the other 
things, I just added a few sample teams,venues and sports.

For this demo, API URLs are hardcoded for simplicity.
In a real application, this should be moved to a .env file.
